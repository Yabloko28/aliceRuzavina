<p>The project focuses on combining fabric manipulation, paper collage and digital work to create enhanced digital prints that have a 3-dimensional feel. Inspired by mystic shapes of Hilma af Klint and bold ceramic collages by Betty Woodman, I’ve combined lots of detailed drawings with colorful paint-ups to reimagine the traditional paisley motif in a more unexpected way.  Dress design is influenced by the quirky ceremonial robes of the 1920s sect “Kibbo Kift”, which focused on outdoor living and pacifism. Made in variety of colors and juxtaposing materials, the dress consists of a flared-sleeve lace-up under top and an apron-like top layer which buttons up on the sides.</p>
