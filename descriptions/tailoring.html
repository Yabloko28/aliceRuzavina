<p>Project made in partnership with Balenciaga Museum in Getartia, as a way to reimagine Cristobal Balenciaga’s design aesthetic and his appreciation for the traditional Spanish crafts.</p>
<p>The main inspiration for this project were the big statement coats and dresses that were Cristobal’s signature pieces in the 60s. I combined their Madonna-like statuesque A-line silhouettes with elaborate embroidery that can be seen on traditional matador jackets, which often incorporate religious elements.I took interest in making my own lace-like screen designs and embroidery inspired by late Yayoi Kusama.  The main design challenge was to flawlessly incorporate a hood into the traditional collar and lapelle jacket structure.  Color scheme came from Pedro Almodovar’s infamous film “Matador”.</p>
