<p>Focusing on border lines as a theme starting point, I looked into Anthony Burgess’ masterpiece “Clockwork Orange”. I wanted to create a hypothetical uniform for the ultra violence gang members, so that it would serve as both protection and trophy. I looked at early Niki de Saint Phalle shooting paintings, Lucio Fontana cut works and Jenny Saville’s body paintings for textile suggestions to see what impact and traces can the act of violence leave on a body. I incorporated those into my design with molded hand traces, cuts and shooting painting marks.</p>
