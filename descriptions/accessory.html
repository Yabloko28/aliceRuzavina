<p>In the heart of this project are multiple drawings made at the exhibition about Russian Avant-garde theatre, which were the starting point for silk-screen designs. By using devore, acid, direct dyes and inks, various textures and colors were achieved. The design is transformative as it can be worn two ways - as a neck piece or as a backpack. The long stripes can be either interwoven in multiple variations or let hang loose.</p>
