<p>This shirt targeted specifically for Elsa Schiaparelli’s market is inspired by the main character of Louis Bunuel’s classic “Belle de Jour”, who leads a double life of an upper-class housewife by night and a prostitute by day. Trompe l’oeil panel structure of the garment reflects this duality and PVC trimming and high pointed collar refers to the vinyl bodysuits found in “Atomage”, a 70s underground kink and fetish magazine. Detailed embroidery and winking eyes allude to surrealist details so loved by Schiaparelli.</p>
