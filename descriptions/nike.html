<p>Project made in partnership with Nike's print department, focusing on the innovation of textiles and their beneficial qualities for the wearer.</p>
<p>The designs are printed on carefully selected sports fabrics that are either waterproof, breathable or heat conserving. Most backings are made out of soft plush material that provides a more comfortable wear. Inspired by the art of optical illusion, samples feature double layers with added transparencies to create a moiré effect when the body is in movement . Barbara Hepworth's futuristic shapes have also inspired the speedy designs. Special heat-sensitive inks are used, turning the samples into transformative pieces when the body temperature rises during active wear, as the colours change and design elements get revealed.</p>
