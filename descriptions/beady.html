<p>While exploring couture craftsmanship through a variety of time-consuming techniques, for this project I learnt lampworking, which enabled me to make my own glass beads from scratch using flame. I also explored the possibilities of bead-making with polymer clay. The main inspiration comes from the face motifs in Hundertwasser’s paintings as well as the beautiful metallic and millefiori tiles that can be found in Niki de Saint-Phalle’s Tarot Garden.</p>
